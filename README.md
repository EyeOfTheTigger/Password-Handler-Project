# Password-Handler-Project
Code for a password handler that creates a database of passwords on your computer and can do various functions from storing passwords and creating new ones.

There are a whole lot of different functions this gui can achieve

What it basically is - 
It creates a .txt file on your computer when you run it where it stores the sites and their passwords

Whenever you start the program, the custom dictionary copies all the data from the txt file and holds it.
Whenever you commit some information to the program, the dictionary accepts it, and overwrites the previous txt file and writes all the data (new or old) to the txt file (Couldn't think of a better way to do it)

The program also has functions like the find function which finds the password of the site you enter, as well as a generate password option.

One thing I am working on currently is to somehow encrypt the passwords I have stored in the txt file.

Looking for constructive criticism on this. Thanks !!
